simple sort  
5, 2, 9, 4, 6, 2, 2, 3, 1  
1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9  
  
**array bellow was not working... so, i'll let here for testing.**  
test1: are equal = true  
  
**sorting an already sorted array not shuffles anything?**  
test2: are equal = true  
  
**okay, lets compare the sort with big lists and the default javascript array sort.**  
Array Size =  10000000  
Took '3706ms' with native sort  
Took '1071ms' with custom sort
